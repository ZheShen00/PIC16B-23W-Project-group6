### Project overview

The movie industry is a complex and competitive field, and predicting the success of an upcoming movie is a challenging task. However, with the advancements in data science and machine learning, it is now possible to use data to build models that can accurately predict the commercial success of a movie. In this project, we will leverage the IMDb database to build an algorithm that can predict whether an upcoming movie will be commercially successful or not.

To build our algorithm, we will first collect and clean the data using SQL and Python. We will then perform exploratory data analysis to identify the features that are most strongly correlated with commercial success. These features could include the genre, production year, length, production budget, and marketing spend. We will then use machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to build our prediction model.

The ultimate goal of this project is to build an accurate and reliable prediction model that can be used by production companies, investors, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about which movies to invest in. By accurately predicting the commercial success of upcoming movies, we can reduce the risk associated with movie production and distribution, and increase the chances of producing movies that will resonate with audiences and generate substantial profits.

Our Process: **Collecting Data --> Cleaning and Making Database --> Modeling --> Making Predctions --> Conclusion**
